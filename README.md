# Sales-Customer-and-Business-Performance-Dashboard

# Overview
This project demonstrates how a multi-page Power BI dashboard can be used to bring together sales, customer, product, and employee performance into a single, decision-ready view for business leaders.

Using Power BI, I analysed transactional and operational data to help businesses:

- Identify revenue drivers

- Understand customer value and buying behavior

- Optimize product and inventory decisions

- Evaluate sales team and office performance

The dashboard is designed for executives and managers, enabling faster, insight-driven decisions across departments.

# Business Problem

Growing businesses often face fragmented reporting across sales, customers, inventory, and teams.

Key challenges addressed:

- Which products and product lines drive the most revenue and profit?

- Which customers generate the highest value?

- Where is revenue being lost due to order issues or delays?

- How do sales reps and offices perform relative to each other?

- How can inventory and procurement be aligned with demand?

# Solution Approach

I built a cross-functional Power BI dashboard that connects multiple business functions into one analytical framework.

**🔹 Sales & Revenue Performance**

- Total Revenue, AOV, Gross Profit, and Margin

- Revenue trends over time

- Revenue by product line, vendor, and order status

**🔹 Customer Analytics**

- Customer spending vs. credit limits

- Order frequency and customer value segmentation

- Geographic distribution of customers

**🔹 Product & Inventory Insights**

- Product line performance

- Stock levels and pricing comparison (MSRP vs. buy price)

- Vendor contribution and dependency analysis

**🔹 Order & Operational Efficiency**

- Order status tracking (Shipped, On Hold, Cancelled)

- Average shipping time and delayed orders

- Revenue leakage due to order issues

**🔹 Employee & Office Performance**

- Sales performance by sales representative

- Office-level sales contribution

- Team size vs. revenue comparison

# Key Business Insights & Impact

- Strong overall performance with ~$9.6M in total revenue and high AOV
 → Confirms premium pricing and strong customer base

- Classic Cars and Vintage Cars dominate revenue
 → Priority product lines for inventory protection and promotions

- On-Hold and Cancelled orders impact high-value products
 → Clear opportunity to recover lost revenue through process improvements

- High-credit customers consistently generate higher revenue
 → Target segment for relationship-driven sales and upselling

- Top sales reps and offices outperform peers significantly
 → Best practices can be replicated across teams

- Operational efficiency is strong, with fast average shipping
 → Logistics is a competitive advantage to protect

# Strategic Recommendations

- Reduce order friction for high-value product lines to prevent revenue leakage

- Build targeted CRM strategies for high-credit, high-value customers

- Align inventory planning with top-performing product lines

- Use sales-rep and office benchmarks to design incentive programs

- Monitor order status and shipping KPIs continuously via dashboards

# Tools & Technologies

- Power BI

- Power Query (data cleaning & transformation)

- DAX (calculated measures & KPIs)

- Relational data modeling

# Why this Matters for Your Business

This project shows how a single dashboard can:

- Replace multiple disconnected reports

- Improve visibility across sales, customers, inventory, and teams

- Support revenue growth and operational efficiency

- Enable leadership to act faster with confidence

The same dashboard framework can be applied to:

- B2B or B2C sales organizations

- Multi-product retail businesses

- Sales-driven teams with distributed offices

# 📌 Note

This project uses a publicly available dataset (Classic Models) for demonstration purposes.

The dashboard structure and insights are directly applicable to real business data.
